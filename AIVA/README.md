# AIVA presence

The AIVA ROS workspace can run a small heartbeat process alongside its future
services. It lets the COC on AuRoRA distinguish the PC companion from the
physical robot. When both AIVA's heartbeat and AuRoRA's rosbridge connection
are online, the COC shows Grace's VRM in the center with AuRoRA's original
pink robot beside her. When only AuRoRA is online, the robot returns to center
at regular size; if only AIVA is online, Grace appears by herself.

Install/build the AIVA workspace, configure the AuRoRA COC's Tailscale Serve
URL, and run this as a user service on the AIVA PC:

```sh
cd ~/AGi/AIVA
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
colcon build --packages-select scs
source install/setup.bash
export AGI_COC_PRESENCE_URL="https://your-aurora-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net/api/presence/aiva"
ros2 run scs aiva-presence
```

Keep AIVA and AuRoRA on the same tailnet and use its ACL/grant rules to restrict
access to your devices. No second COC account is required. The heartbeat expires
12 seconds after the last successful request by default; the sender posts every
4 seconds. `AGI_PRESENCE_INTERVAL` changes the sender interval, and
`AGI_AIVA_PRESENCE_TIMEOUT` changes the COC expiration period.

To keep presence in sync with the PC power state, install the user service after
building the package:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/agi ~/.config/systemd/user
printf '%s\n' 'AGI_COC_PRESENCE_URL=https://your-aurora-machine.your-tailnet.ts.net/api/presence/aiva' > ~/.config/agi/aiva-presence.env
cp ~/AGi/AIVA/systemd/agi-aiva-presence.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable --now agi-aiva-presence.service
```

The service starts with your AIVA user session and stops when the PC shuts down.
Replace the URL with the HTTPS host shown by `tailscale serve status` on AuRoRA.
